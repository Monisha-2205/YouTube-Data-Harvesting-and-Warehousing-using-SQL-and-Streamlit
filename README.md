# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing-using-SQL-and-Streamlit
This project focuses on harvesting data from a YouTube channel using the YouTube API and organizing the collected data into a structured format using pandas. The cleaned data is temporarily stored in dataframes before being transferred to a SQL-based data warehouse.
